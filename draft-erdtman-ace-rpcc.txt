     Raw-Public-Key and Pre-Shared-Key as OAuth client credentials
                       draft-erdtman-ace-rpcc-00

Abstract

   This document describes Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication
   using Raw-Public-Key and Pre-Shared-Key as the mechanism for OAuth
   client authentication to the token endpoint.  Defined for TLS but
   equaly applicable for DTLS.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication
   using Raw-Public-Key and Pre-Shared-Key as the mechanism for OAuth
   client authentication to the token endpoint.

   The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC6749] defines a shared
   secret method of client authentication but also allows for the
   definition and use of additional client authentication mechanisms
   when interacting with the authorization server's token endpoint.
   This document describes two additional mechanisms of client
   authentication utilizing Raw-Public-Key and Pre-Shared-Key TLS, which
   provides better security characteristics than shared secrets.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Pre-Shared-Key for Client Authentication

   The following section defines, as an extension of OAuth 2.0,
   Section 2.3 [RFC6749], the use of Pre-Shared-Key with TLS as client
   credentials.  Registered as 'tls_client_psk' in "OAuth Token Endpoint
   Authentication Methods" registry.

   Handshake is done according to [RFC4279], client indicates support
   for Pre-Shared-Key cipher suit and authorization server selects the
   Pre-Shared-Key cipher suit.  To enable authorization server to select
   the correct Pre shared key client MUST send its client id in the

   ClientHello or ClientKeyExchange message.  How the authorization
   server maps a client id to a the client PSK is out of scope for this
   specification.

   TBD: define exactly how client id is sent to server in handshake, it
   looks like one option would be to send it in "PSK identity" in the
   ClientKeyExchange message.

3.  Raw-Public-Key for Client Authentication

   The following section defines, as an extension of OAuth 2.0,
   Section 2.3 [RFC6749], the use of Raw-Public-Key with DTLS as client
   credentials.  Registered as 'tls_client_rpk' in "OAuth Token Endpoint
   Authentication Methods" registry.

   Handshake is done according to [RFC7250], client indicates support
   for Raw-Public-Key certificate and authorization server asks client
   send its Raw Public Key certificate.  To enable authorization server
   to validate the client RPK it MUST send its client id in the
   ClientHello or ClientKeyExchange message.  How the authorization
   server maps a client id to a the client RPK is out of scope for this
   specification.

   TBD: define exactly how client id is sent to server in handshake.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Token Endpoint Authentication Method Registration

   This specification requests registration of the following value in
   the IANA "OAuth Token Endpoint Authentication Methods" registry
   [IANA.OAuth.Parameters] established by [RFC7591].

5.1.1.  Registry Contents

   o  Token Endpoint Authentication Method Name: "tls_client_rpk"
   o  Change Controller: IESG
   o  Specification Document(s): [[ this specification ]]
